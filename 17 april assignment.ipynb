    "Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning algorithm used for regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous value. It is an ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners (simple models) to create a strong learner that can make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by iteratively adding new weak learners to the ensemble, each one correcting the errors of the previous ones. In each iteration, the algorithm fits a new weak learner to the residuals (the difference between the predicted and actual values) of the previous iteration. The idea is to gradually reduce the residuals until they are minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The weak learners used in Gradient Boosting Regression are usually decision trees, which are simple models that can capture non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. However, unlike traditional decision trees, which are built independently, the decision trees in Gradient Boosting Regression are built sequentially, with each one focusing on the examples that were poorly predicted by the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind Gradient Boosting Regression is to use gradient descent to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted and actual values. The gradient descent algorithm updates the parameters of the weak learner in each iteration to minimize this loss function. The learning rate parameter controls how much each new weak learner contributes to the final prediction.\n",

    "Gradient Boosting Regression has several advantages over other regression algorithms, such as its ability to handle non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable, its robustness to outliers, and its ability to capture complex interactions between features. However, it can be computationally expensive and prone to overfitting if not properly regularized"
